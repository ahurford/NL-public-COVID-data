# NL-public-COVID-data

On this site I will archive publicly available COVID-19 data sets for Newfoundland and Labrador and provide cleaned versions of some of the files. This repository is a work in progress.

1. For data recorded from the NL data hub since March 14, 2022 see: https://github.com/ahurford/covid-nl-2022
2. For provincial-level data to March 11, 2022, downloaded from the Newfoundland and Labrador government website see: https://github.com/ahurford/covid-nl/blob/main/NL-Hub/Prov_stats.csv
3. For a copy of the latest epidemiological data from PHAC (all provinces), see: https://github.com/ahurford/covid-nl/blob/main/covid19-download.csv
