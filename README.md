# NL-public-COVID-data

On this site I will archive publicly available COVID-19 data sets for Newfoundland and Labrador and provide cleaned versions of some of the files. This repository is a work in progress.

2. On this site, NL_prov_stats.csv is provincial-level data to March 11, 2022 downloaded from the Newfoundland and Labrador government website (click "Code" to download).
3. For a copy of the latest epidemiological data from PHAC (all provinces), see: https://github.com/ahurford/covid-nl/blob/main/covid19-download.csv or download directly from PHAC here: https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html
